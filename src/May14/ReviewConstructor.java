	/*Object -- instance of class or actual object created 
	Class 
	  is a blueprint/ template to an object 
	  fields/ variables 
	    -- instance variable -- define properties of object
	    -- static variable  -- this is coming tomorrow 
	    
	  methods 
	    -- instance methods --->  
	       we need an object to use it 
	       and it's mostly used for reading/ manipulating object's property 
	       
	    
	    -- static methods 
	      no object needed to use it 
	      and mostly used for utility method 
	        that has nothing to do with object's properties 
	        
	  Constructor 
	    -- this is a special block of code that run automatically 
	       each time an object is being created 
	       
	    -- it has same name as current Class
	    -- it does not have return type 
	    -- it can have any type of access modifier
	    
	    We can have multiple version of constructor 
	      -- overloading 
	          -- same rule apply as method (same name diff param list)
	       
	       public AC{
	         
	           boolean on; 
	           
	           same name as classname and must not have return type
	           THIS IS NOT A CONSTRUCTOR 
	           It is just a method happen to have same name as class name
	           and return type is void 
	           
	           public void AC(){
	             sysout("boom!")
	           }
	           
	       
	       }
	       
	       in Main method
	       AC ac1 = new AC() ; 
	       
	       
	       If a constructor is not defined in the class 
	       compiler will provide one 
	           --->>> default constructor -- no arg empty constructor 
	       What if we have any constructor exists in the class
	           --->>> we don't get default constructor by compiler 
	           
	    
	    What's the most useful way to use constructor 
	       initilize all the field values of an object while being created*/
